# 3.x Heartbeat

The sensors periodically send their data through all channels they can: this is known as sensor heartbeat. The sensors try broadcast the data, if GATT is connected the sensor data is sent via GATT and NFC data field is updated to include the latest data. 

The heartbeat also feeds the watchdog of the application, if the data updates stop for any reason the application assumes that it has crashed and reboots.
