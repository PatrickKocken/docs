# Naming conventions



| Field | Name | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Temperature | temperature | Celcius \(C\) |
| Humidity | humidity | RH percentage \(RH-%\) |
| Pressure | pressure |  Pascal \(Pa\) |
| Acceleration on X-axis | accelerationX |  Gravity \(g\) |
| Acceleration on Y-axis | accelerationY |  Gravity \(g\) |
| Acceleration on Z-axis | accelerationZ |  Gravity \(g\) |
| Supply voltage | batteryVoltage |  Volt \(V\) |
| Transmitted power | txPower | Decibel to one [milliwatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliwatt) \(dBm\) |
| Movement counter | movementCounter | Unitless |
| Measurement Sequence Number | measurementSequenceNumber |  Unitless |
| Received Signal Strength Indication | rssi | Decibel, relative \(dB\) |
| ID | tagID | Unitless, typically MAC address of device. Capital letters, separated by ":". e.g. A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6 |
